# Assignment 1: Mapping the spatial distribution of greenspace with median house prices, London. 

## Choice of a data and aims
•	Aim is to visualize the spatial distribution of green spaces and transport connections in Greater London, and their relationship with house prices. The main aim is to understand to what extent green space (or type of green space) relates to house prices. Is there monetary value to such amenities that studies have increasingly shown to be benefical for physical/mental health (ref) – are they equitably distributed within London? Can parks be desirable or ‘green walls’? (ref) Mapping transport connections to control for areas which might be more desirable because of their transportation links, and to provide some context. 
•	The dataset is sourced from Ordinance Survey and Greenspace for Greater London (GiGL) which was made available, in response to the National Park City movement.  To support value of greenspace and their contribution to public health, and includes information on the functions of spaces.  
•	London median house price data was taken from the London Ward atlas dataset. Median values to mitigate the effect of any significant outliers but the housing stock should be taken into account. 
•	 Transport layer include for rail and underground services, buses and stations excluded as it overcrowded the map at this scale. This is an OS datalayer from geofabrick. 

## ArcGIS
A GUI-based software.
Setting up a geodatabase and workspace (units, projection)
Cleaning csv data is tedious and largely manual process. 
Importing the data layers as shapefiles but saved as feature classes. All data used in the map exported to geodatabase as feature classes, as they overcome some of the issues with shapefiles and storing attributes to spatial information (ref).  Properties of feature classes were verified to be British National Grid, no re-projections necessary. 

Making the map involved joining the house price data to ward boundaries to create a choropleth map. Jenks breaks were used to classify colour boundaries.

A grayscale was chosen to create a visual contrast between this dataset and the greenspaces/transport links. A limitation of natural break algorythms is their tendency to miss obvious cut-off points (ref – lying with maps), or comparison figures like the London-wide median. To be transparent about the variance and cut-off points the histogram can be plotted(visual) and the London average can be noted on the side of the map for reference.

To create the greenspace dataset for London only, select by location and export to a featureclass. The dataset was spatially joined to ward boundaries to create a dataset on the number of green spaces per ward. As the dataset is difficult to understand as a whole (disaggregate data and spatial) Statistics on the overall number of each type of greenspace in greater London can be added to the legend to provide an extra level of detail, as many spaces are too small to understand. Another key distinguishing feature between functions categories was the size of the spaces, so a bubble diagram provides information on average size. In terms of symbology for the green spaces, a green scale was used to conform to traditional convention, yet to distinguish between the nominal attributes (visuals- diagram and legend). 

Finally, a transport layer was added to provide context, to understand i) areas that are well connected which might explain higher house prices and ii) wards with main interchanges that may be less residential than other wards. It would be useful to include what proportion of a ward is actually residential to understand the sample sizes the house price data is taken from.
The layout feature of ArcGIS is a useful way to organize the output of the map, through dataframes allowing different scale displays and different layers of information. Elements such as scale bars and orientation were easy to add and style. Because of the map’s static nature and high level of information, a central part of London has been displayed, with the entirety of greater London displayed  for context in a smaller scale adjacent. 
Interactive, iterative and visual way to build maps. Easy to review the structure and hierarchy of layers in use. This made levels of uncertainty easier/quicker to review (visuals of borough vs ward level of data)

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
